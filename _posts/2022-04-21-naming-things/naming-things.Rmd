```{r setup, include=FALSE}

               install = FALSE, update = FALSE)

# This is needed to use PANELS

```

```{r, xaringanExtra-clipboard, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}

  xaringanExtra::use_clipboard(
    button_text = "<i class=\"fa fa-clone fa-2x\" style=\"color: #004276\"></i>",

This is a  brief note on *best practices* for naming files and directories. There is no universal convention that I am aware of but you can save yourself a lot of trouble by following a few simple rules when naming files and directories.

> Your task is to ensure your files are **Machine readable** and **Human readable**.

**Never** use special characters in your file name (e.g., `* # : \ / < > | " ? [ ] ; = + & Â£ $`,  and so on). Letters and numbers **only**. Many of these symbols are prohibited and a lot of software will reject files that contain these symbols. 

Periods `.` should only be used for a file extension, like `document.html`. If you put a period `.` at the beginning of a file or directory name, like `.bash_profile`, then it will be hidden by default. Do not do this at the beginning of a name unless you know what you are doing :) 

**Do not** use spaces. Separate words using a dash (`-`) or an underscore (`_`), like `how-to-use-this-site.Rmd`. You can also use camel case if you prefer, like `howToUseThisSite.Rmd`.

The file name should be short but meaningful. This is important when dealing with a lot of files, like for a website. So add relevant details but keep it less than 25 characters---long file names mean long URLs, which can increase the likelihood of errors.. 

If you include a date in the name, use date format [ISO_8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) `YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYYMMDD`. Distill blog sites use `YYYY-MM-DD` by default. 

You can begin a file/directory name with a number, just be sure to use sequential numbering like `01_File`, `02_Stuff`, etc. instead of `1_File` and `2_Stuff`.

Whatever approach you choose, I think the main key is to be consistent. If you use dashes `-` to separate words in a name, then try to stick with that for everything.
